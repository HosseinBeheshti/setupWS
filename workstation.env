# ============================================================
# Secure Remote Access Gateway Configuration
# ============================================================
#
# This configuration file defines settings for a hybrid secure access solution:
# - WireGuard VPN for all-traffic routing through your VPS
# - Cloudflare Zero Trust for secure SSH/VNC access management
# - L2TP/IPSec as fallback VPN option
#
# ARCHITECTURE:
#   - WireGuard VPN: Full tunnel VPN service for client devices (all traffic)
#   - L2TP/IPsec: Application-specific VPN for routing VPN_APPS in VNC sessions
#   - Cloudflare Access: Identity-aware SSH/VNC access (no traffic routing)
#
# MAIN SCRIPTS:
#   sudo ./setup_ws.sh        - ONE-TIME VPS setup (installs WireGuard, L2TP, VNC, Cloudflare)
#   sudo ./run_vpn.sh         - Run L2TP VPN for VPN_APPS (use in VNC sessions)
#
# SETUP WORKFLOW:
#   1. Complete Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard setup (Part 1 in README.md):
#      - Create Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared, NOT WARP Connector)
#      - Configure Identity Provider and Admin Policy
#      - Set up SSH/VNC Access Applications
#      - Copy tunnel token to CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN below
#   
#   2. Edit this file (workstation.env):
#      - Add your CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN
#      - Configure VNC users (usernames, passwords, ports)
#      - Configure WireGuard settings (ports, subnet, client count)
#      - Set VPS IP address
#   
#   3. Run setup script:
#      sudo ./setup_ws.sh
#      (Installs all apps, configures WireGuard, sets up Cloudflare Access)
#   
#   4. Client setup:
#      - For VPN: Install WireGuard client with generated config
#      - For SSH/VNC: Install Cloudflare One Agent for secure access
#
# USER ACCESS:
#   - Client VPN: WireGuard (all traffic exits via VPS IP) - for any device
#   - VNC Session VPN: L2TP/IPsec (for routing specific apps in VNC) - run ./run_vpn.sh
#   - SSH/VNC Access: Cloudflare Access with Gmail + One-time PIN
#
# CONFIGURATION REQUIRED BELOW:
#   1. CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN (from tunnel creation in dashboard)
#   2. VPS IP address
#   3. WireGuard settings (server port, subnet)
#   4. VNC user passwords (VNCUSER*_PASSWORD)
#   5. L2TP/IPsec credentials (for VPN_APPS routing in VNC sessions)

# ============================================================
# --- CLOUDFLARE TUNNEL CONFIGURATION (for SSH/VNC Access) ---
# ============================================================
# Cloudflare Tunnel token from Cloudflare dashboard
# Get this from: Networks → Tunnels → Create tunnel → cloudflared (NOT WARP Connector)
# After creating the tunnel, copy the token from the installation command

CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN="<cloudflare_tunnel_token>"

# Tunnel name (must match the name you created in Cloudflare dashboard)

# --- WIREGUARD VPN CONFIGURATION ---
# ============================================================
# WireGuard Server Settings

WG_SERVER_ADDRESS="10.8.0.1/24"  # VPN subnet for WireGuard
WG_CLIENT_DNS="1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1"  # DNS servers for clients

# Note: Server keypairs will be auto-generated during setup
# Client management: Use ./manage_wg_client.sh to add/remove clients

# ============================================================
# --- VNC USERS CONFIGURATION ---
# ============================================================
# Configure VNC server users for remote desktop access
# Each user gets their own VNC server instance on a dedicated port

# ============================================================
# --- L2TP/IPSEC VPN CONFIGURATION (for VPN_APPS in VNC) ---
# ============================================================
# L2TP is used to route specific applications through a remote VPN
# Run 'sudo ./run_vpn.sh' in your VNC session to activate L2TP
# WireGuard is a separate independent VPN service for client devices

# --- L2TP VPN Configuration ---

# --- VPN Applications Configuration ---
# Applications to route through L2TP VPN when running ./run_vpn.sh
# These apps will have their traffic routed through L2TP when VPN is active in VNC session

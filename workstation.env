# Cloudflare WARP Connector VPN Replacement Configuration
# ============================================================
#
# This configuration file defines settings for Cloudflare WARP Connector
# deployment - a complete VPN replacement that routes ALL client traffic
# through your VPS with Zero Trust security.
#
# ARCHITECTURE:
#   - Client devices connect with Cloudflare One Agent (WARP client)
#   - ALL traffic (DNS, web, apps, games) routes through WARP Connector on VPS
#   - Gateway filtering applied to all protocols (DNS/Network/HTTP)
#   - Direct SSH/VNC access to VPS management (standard ports)
#   - L2TP/IPSec fallback VPN for devices without WARP support
#
# MAIN SCRIPTS:
#   sudo ./setup_server.sh    - ONE-TIME VPS setup (installs & configures everything)
#
# SETUP WORKFLOW:
#   1. Complete Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard setup (Part 1 in README.md):
#      - Create WARP Connector tunnel
#      - Copy tunnel token to CLOUDFLARE_WARP_TOKEN below
#      - Configure device enrollment
#      - Configure split tunnels
#   
#   2. Edit this file (workstation.env):
#      - Add your CLOUDFLARE_WARP_TOKEN
#      - Configure VNC users (usernames, passwords, ports)
#      - Set VPS IP address
#   
#   3. Run setup script:
#      sudo ./setup_server.sh
#      (Installs all apps, registers WARP Connector, starts VNC servers)
#   
#   4. Client setup:
#      - Install Cloudflare One Agent
#      - Authenticate with your email
#      - All traffic now routes through VPS
#
# USER ACCESS:
#   - Authentication: Gmail + One-time PIN (configured in Cloudflare dashboard)
#   - Traffic routing: ALL protocols through WARP Connector
#   - Exit IP: Your VPS IP address
#   - SSH/VNC: Direct access to VPS management (ports 22, 5910, 5911)
#   - Fallback: L2TP/IPSec for devices without WARP support
#
# CONFIGURATION REQUIRED BELOW:
#   1. CLOUDFLARE_WARP_TOKEN (from tunnel creation in dashboard)
#   2. VPS IP address
#   3. VNC user passwords (VNCUSER*_PASSWORD)
#   4. Optional: L2TP/IPSec credentials for fallback VPN

# ============================================================
# Secure Remote Access Gateway Configuration
# ============================================================
#
# This configuration file defines settings for a hybrid secure access solution:
# - L2TP/IPSec as VPN option for application-specific routing in VNC sessions
# - Cloudflare Zero Trust for secure SSH/VNC access management
# - Cloudflare WARP custom endpoint to bypass ISP filtering
#
# ARCHITECTURE:
#   - L2TP/IPsec: Application-specific VPN for routing VPN_APPS in VNC sessions
#   - Cloudflare Access: Identity-aware SSH/VNC access (no traffic routing)
#   - Cloudflare WARP: Custom endpoint through VPS tunnel (bypasses filtering)
#
# MAIN SCRIPTS:
#   sudo ./setup_ws.sh        - ONE-TIME VPS setup (installs L2TP, VNC, Cloudflare)
#   sudo ./run_vpn.sh         - Run L2TP VPN for VPN_APPS (use in VNC sessions)
#
# SETUP WORKFLOW:
#   1. Complete Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard setup (Part 1 in README.md):
#      - Create Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared, NOT WARP Connector)
#      - Configure Identity Provider and Admin Policy
#      - Set up SSH/VNC Access Applications
#      - Copy tunnel token to CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN below
#   
#   2. Edit this file (workstation.env):
#      - Add your CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN
#      - Configure VNC users (usernames, passwords, ports)
#      - Set VPS IP address
#   
#   3. Run setup script:
#      sudo ./setup_ws.sh
#      (Installs all apps, sets up Cloudflare Access)
#   
#   4. Client setup:
#      - For SSH/VNC: Install Cloudflare One Agent for secure access
#
# USER ACCESS:
#   - VNC Session VPN: L2TP/IPsec (for routing specific apps in VNC) - run ./run_vpn.sh
#   - SSH/VNC Access: Cloudflare Access with Gmail + One-time PIN
#
# CONFIGURATION REQUIRED BELOW:
#   1. CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN (from tunnel creation in dashboard)
#   2. VPS IP address
#   3. VNC user passwords (VNCUSER*_PASSWORD)
#   4. L2TP/IPsec credentials (for VPN_APPS routing in VNC sessions)

# Installing required applications on the VPS 
# (without configuring them)

# ============================================================
# --- CLOUDFLARE TUNNEL CONFIGURATION (for SSH/VNC Access) ---
# ============================================================
# Cloudflare Tunnel token from Cloudflare dashboard
# Get this from: Networks → Tunnels → Create tunnel → cloudflared (NOT WARP Connector)
# After creating the tunnel, copy the token from the installation command

# Tunnel name (must match the name you created in Cloudflare dashboard)
TUNNEL_NAME="vps-access"

# VPS public IP address

# WARP Routing Configuration (to bypass ISP filtering)
# Enables socat UDP relay: VPS:443 → Cloudflare WireGuard (162.159.193.5:2408)
# Clients use: warp-cli registration set-custom-endpoint VPS_IP:443
WARP_ROUTING_ENABLED="true"
WARP_ROUTING_PORT="443"  # Port for WARP relay (default: 443 for better firewall traversal)

# --- VNC USERS CONFIGURATION ---
# ============================================================
# Configure VNC server users for remote desktop access
# Each user gets their own VNC server instance on a dedicated port

# ============================================================
# --- L2TP/IPSEC VPN CONFIGURATION (for VPN_APPS in VNC) ---
# ============================================================
# L2TP is used to route specific applications through a remote VPN
# Run 'sudo ./run_vpn.sh' in your VNC session to activate L2TP
# Note: L2TP is only for app-specific routing in VNC sessions

# --- L2TP VPN Configuration ---

L2TP_REMOTE_PC_IP='<remote_pc_ip>'

# --- VPN Applications Configuration ---
# Applications to route through L2TP VPN when running ./run_vpn.sh
# These apps will have their traffic routed through L2TP when VPN is active in VNC session
# Note: L2TP is only for app-specific routing in VNC sessions
